<ul>
<li><h3>Pages in the system</h3>

<ul><li><a name='preferences'>Fill</a> out your <a
href="preferences.php">preference form</a> by the deadline listed in
the form, so that your workshift manager can assign workshifts in
accordance with your preferences (shifts you want/don't want, times
you can make, special requests, etc.).  It's a good idea to print out
your preference form when it's filled out, and definitely to save the
resulting page after you submit your preferences, and possibly print
it out, just in case your preferences aren't submitted properly.

<li><a href="person.php" name='person'>Your personal page</a> has
information about shifts you have done, access to your preference form
if you need to change your preferences before shifts have been
assigned, and any other goodies your house might have (in Stebbins you
can <a href="voting.php">vote in elections</a>).

<ul><li>At the top, you have links to everything you should need to go
to on the site -- your preferences, a link to change your password, a
directory of the whole house, and links to elections (only applicable
if your house has online elections).

<li>Below that is a list of your shifts.  You can click on any shift
to see the description of that shift that the workshift manager has
entered.

<li>Below that comes the real stuff.  First comes your net hours.  If
it's in red, you're below 0.  Green is above.  Know your house's
fining policy!

<li>Fines follow.  Fines that occurred at fining periods are listed on
the left, and other fines to the right.  If your house has weekly
fines, they will be in the middle.  You'll see subtotals for each
category of fine, and a total fine below that.  Remember that negative
numbers are actually credits (meaning the workshift manager entered
that you paid a fine, or worked off a fine, etc.).

<li>Next comes a line telling you when the fining periods have been,
and when the future ones will be.  If you have worked out an
arrangement with your workshift manager for different fining periods,
that will be displayed here.

<li>Now comes a list of every shift that you have done this semester,
organized by week.  At the end of each week, there is a line giving
the net (done-blown) hours you did that week, how many hours you owed
for that week, the week's change (net-owed), and your running total --
your total through this week.  If you incurred fines at the end of
this week, either because of a fining period or because your house has
weekly fining, they will also be displayed here.

<li>If you have a question about hours that you've done, look
carefully at this list of shifts until you see what the discrepancy
is.  That will help you and the workshift manager to resolve the
question faster, and will probably make him/her less grumpy.

<li>If there are mysterious terms in your personal page and you don't
understand them, they might <a href='#personal_terms'>be below</a>.
</ul>

<li><a href='directory.php' name='directory'>The directory</a> has
your entire house, along with the information that each member chooses
to make public.  The email addresses can be directly copied and pasted
into an email, but don't do that unless you have a good reason.  Come
on now.  You can choose to let people view your room, email, and phone
number (assuming you've entered those things).  Otherwise, only the
workshift manager can see them.  Remember, nobody can ever see your
password.

<li><a href="weekly_totals.php" name='weekly_totals'>The weekly
totals</a> have the running totals of the house's workshift hours.
You can uncheck the column boxes to hide columns you don't want to
look at, and you can restrict to looking at any one person's totals by
choosing their name in the drop-down box (although that may only work
in Firefox).  If you have questions about whether your shift hours
were counted properly, you can check <a href="person.php">your
personal page</a> to see a complete record of the shifts the workshift
manager has you down as doing.  As well, the last two columns have any
notes the workshift manager has for you, and the amount you were fined
this past week.  Note that the fining amount is not cumulative, so if
you were fined $10 one week, and $10 the next week, that means your
total fine is $20 -- $10 twice.

<li><a href='online_signoff.php' name='online_signoff'>Online
signoff</a> may be available in your house.  If it is, then you can
sign off there.  Choose your name.  A list of your shifts should
appear.  If you are signing off for one of your regular shifts, choose
it there.  If that's it, then just get a verifier to enter their name
and password, and submit.  You should see a message at the top saying
you've been signed off, and your name should appear in a list at the
bottom.  Here's some more information about this page:

<ul><li>If you did a shift for a different number of hours than usual,
you can change it next to the shift name.  You can also enter a note,
at the top, for the workshift manager.  By default, there will be a
note saying the shift was signed off of online, and if you made any
changes, what those changes were.

<li>If you want to sign off for someone else's shift that you've
done, select it in the second set of boxes.  Choose the day/date you
did the shift, and a list of shifts should open up.  Choose the one
you did.  In the case that multiple people are assigned that shift, a
list of people who do the shift will open up.  Choose the one whose
shift you took.  As before, if you don't need to change the number of
hours it was worth, just submit.  If you do, change it and submit.

<li>If you were assigned a special, one-time shift, enter it in the
special category.  Make sure to put in a good description, so the
workshift manager knows what you did, and maybe leave a note.

<li>Shifts don't show up for online signoff if they ended too long
ago.  If you did a shift too long ago for it to show up, you'll have
to speak to your workshift manager.

<li>You can see a list of recently-signed off online shifts at the
bottom of the form.  If you have any questions about a signoff, click
on the member's name to send an email to the workshift manager.  If
you're not sure what the requirements of the shift were, click on it
to be taken to its description.
</ul>

<li><a href="../public_utils/shifts_by_name.php"
name='shifts_by_name'>Workshifts by name</a> tells you what workshifts
each person is assigned.

<li><a href='shift_descriptions.php' name='shift_descriptions'>Shift
descriptions</a> should have a detailed description of each shift so
that you know exactly what you need to do.  The number of hours a
shift is worth is in parentheses.  The Earliest starting time, if
entered, is the earliest that you can start your shift on the day
you're supposed to do it, and similarly for the Latest ending time.

<li><a href='workshift_doc.php' name='workshift_doc'>The workshift
policy document</a> can be downloaded if your workshift manager has
uploaded it.  You should be able to download/view it directly on your
computer.

<li><a href='index.php' name='index.php'>The home page</a> has
everyone's name and hours.  You can click on your name to log in to
your personal page.
</ul>

<li><a name='personal_terms'><h4>Miscellaneous terms you might come
across on your personal page</h4></a> <ul>
<li><a name='nonzeroed_total'>If your house keeps track of nonzeroed
hours (and it does, if you clicked on a link to get here), then your
house uses nonzeroed hours, that is, your hours where any hours you've
paid fines on are still counted as down hours, for something.  It's
probably termination, so if this number drops below the termination
level, then termination proceedings will be started even if your usual
hours total is not at termination level.

<li><a name='cash_hours'>If your house has automatic cashing-in of
hours (and it does, if you clicked on a link to get here), any up
hours you have at the end of the semester will be applied towards any
workshift fines that you may have incurred.  If you're not up hours,
then nothing will happen, but this just lets you know what will
happen.  Your fines will be similarly modified.  If you have already
paid your fines, you may be eligible to get a refund of part or all of
them.
