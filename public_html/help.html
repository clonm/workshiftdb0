<ul>
<li><h3>Pages in the system</h3>
<ul><li>Fill out your <a href="preferences.php">preference form</a> by
the deadline listed in the form, so that your workshift manager can
assign workshifts in accordance with your preferences (shifts you
want/don't want, times you can make, special requests, etc.).  It's a
good idea to print out your preference form when it's filled out, and
definitely to save the resulting page after you submit your
preferences, and possibly print it out, just in case your preferences
aren't submitted properly.
<li><a href="person.php">Your personal page</a> has information about
shifts you have done, access to your preference form if you need to
change your preferences before shifts have been assigned, and any
other goodies your house might have (in Stebbins you can <a
href="voting.php">vote in elections</a>).
<li><a href="weekly_totals.php">The weekly totals</a> have the running
totals of the house's workshift hours.  You can uncheck the column
boxes to hide columns you don't want to look at, and you can restrict
to looking at any one person's totals by choosing their name in the
drop-down box (although that may only work in Firefox).  If you have
questions about whether your shift hours were counted properly, you
can check <a href="person.php">your personal page</a> to see a
complete record of the shifts the workshift manager has you down as
doing.  As well, the last two columns have any notes the workshift
manager has for you, and the amount you were fined this past week.
Note that the fining amount is not cumulative, so if you were fined
$10 one week, and $10 the next week, that means your total fine is $20
-- $10 twice.
<li><a href="../public_utils/shifts_by_name.php">Workshifts by
name</a> tells you what workshifts each person is assigned.
<li><a name='cash_hours'>If your house has automatic cashing-in of
hours (and it does, if you clicked on a link to get here), any up
hours you have at the end of the semester will be applied towards any
workshift fines that you may have incurred.  If you're not up hours,
then nothing will happen, but this just lets you know what will
happen.  Your fines will be similarly modified.  If you have already
paid your fines, you may be eligible to get a refund of part or all of
them.
<li><a href='online_signoff.php'>Online signoff</a> may be available
in your house.  If it is, then you can sign off there.  Choose your
name.  A list of your shifts should appear.  If you are signing off
for one of your regular shifts, choose it there.  If that's it, then
just get a verifier to enter their name and password, and submit.  You
should see a message at the top saying you've been signed off, and
your name should appear in a list at the bottom.  Here's some more
information about this page:

<ul><li>If you did a shift for a different number of hours than usual,
you can change it next to the shift name.  You can also enter a note,
at the top, for the workshift manager.  By default, there will be a
note saying the shift was signed off of online, and if you made any
changes, what those changes were.

<li>If you want to sign off for someone else's shift that you've
done, select it in the second set of boxes.  Choose the day/date you
did the shift, and a list of shifts should open up.  Choose the one
you did.  In the case that multiple people are assigned that shift, a
list of people who do the shift will open up.  Choose the one whose
shift you took.  As before, if you don't need to change the number of
hours it was worth, just submit.  If you do, change it and submit.

<li>If you were assigned a special, one-time shift, enter it in the
special category.  Make sure to put in a good description, so the
workshift manager knows what you did, and maybe leave a note.

<li>Shifts don't show up for online signoff if they ended too long
ago.  If you did a shift too long ago for it to show up, you'll have
to speak to your workshift manager.

<li>You can see a list of recently-signed off online shifts at the
bottom of the form.  If you have any questions about a signoff, click
on the member's name to send an email to the workshift manager.  If
you're not sure what the requirements of the shift were, click on it
to be taken to its description.
</ul>

<li><a name='nonzeroed_total'>If your house keeps track of nonzeroed
hours (and it does, if you clicked on a link to get here), then your
house uses nonzeroed hours, that is, your hours where any hours you've
paid fines on are still counted as down hours, for something.  It's
probably termination, so if this number drops below the termination
level, then termination proceedings will be started even if your usual
hours total is not at termination level.
</ul>
