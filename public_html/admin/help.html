<ul>

<li><h3>Tasks you can do, and the order you should do them in</h3> 

The <b>first thing</b> you have to do is make sure you can view <a
href='index.html'>your front page</a>, using whatever username and
password were specified by your administrator (the default is
(three-letter-house-code)laborczar for both the username and password,
like stblaborczar for Stebbins).  Your front page has links to
everything mentioned here.  Make sure you can log in to it.  (If you
can't, contact the administrator.)

<ul>

  <li><a name='basic_consts'><h4>Set basic constants</h4> Go to <a
  href='basic_consts.php'>basic_consts.php</a> to set some basic
  parameters, like when the semester started and when preferences
  forms are due.

<ul><li>
  Since this page can change a lot of things, it backs up your system
  before it does anything, so that the old system can be completely
  restored if necessary.  If you want to give a name to this backup,
  enter it in the box -- otherwise, it will just use the current date
  and time so that if you need to restore a backup, you know exactly
  when it is from.

  <li>The "start of the semester" section is for cleaning up previous
  semesters' data.  The first box deletes members' preference forms.
  Some members may have preferences that haven't changed much, but if
  you don't delete them, you may be misled about their availability,
  so it's probably a good idea to delete them.  The next box deletes
  the assigned shifts, so that when you're assigning shifts, you're
  starting from a blank slate.  Definitely don't check it until the
  previous semester ends, because otherwise the shift assignments will
  be lost.  The third and final box should only be checked when the
  next semester has started, and everything from the previous semester
  has finished, i.e., all workshift entries have finished, fines have
  been calculated, etc.  The old semester is still available for
  viewing through various <a href='view_backup'>archive methods</a> or
  restoring, if it turns out that it didn't actually end.

  <li>The preference forms are set up here, because you need to get
  them ready right away for your house.

  <ul><li>The preference forms can either let users choose shifts that
  they want and shifts that they don't want, or it can let users
  rate/rank categories of shifts.  Choose which you prefer here.  Note
  that if you want the rating/ranking system, you are going to have to
  <a href='assign_shifts.php'>enter a category for each shift</a> or
  your members will have to rate every single one of your shifts,
  since each will be in its own category.  Note that if you put a
  single * in the category, the system will treat this as a special
  shift, and will not put it on the preference form.  If you put **,
  the system will also not put it in signoff sheets or weekly sheets.
  
  <li>If you don't enter the preferences due date and shifts start
  date, <a href='../preferences.php'>preferences.php</a> will look
  silly.  You can also change the text that appears on the preferences
  page.  The first textbox contains the text which goes at the top of
  the form.  The second contains the text right before where the
  members will enter their shift preferences.  There are a few options
  you can choose about these.  If you would like this text to be
  rendered as html (so things like &lt;strong&gt; make things strong,
  and you can put links in, etc.), then check the box, and otherwise
  uncheck it.  Remember that if it's html, to make a line break, you
  have to put in &lt;br&gt; or &lt;p&gt;, not just press the "enter"
  key.  The second thing you can do is put in 
  <a href='#escape_sequences'>escape sequences</a>.  If you're using
  the wanted/unwanted style for shift preferences, there are no escape
  sequences for that text, but otherwise, read the instructions.
  </ul>

  <li>The houselist question is so that the system can deal with the
  houselists that CO sends you, that you can <a
  href='update_house.php'>upload</a> to set the house list.<br>

</ul>
<li><a name='update_house'><h4>Enter house list</h4> You need to have a house list entered.
  You can do that at <a href='update_house.php'>update_house.php</a>.
  Make sure every member's name you enter is unique.  Try to enter
  them in a consistent format, like Lastname, Firstname (what Stebbins
  does), LastNameFirstname, or whatever.  Just keep it consistent.
  Since there is auto-completion on most of the pages, don't worry too
  much about length of names -- you won't have to type the whole thing
  in every time.  The best way to do this is to email <a
  href='mailto:housing@usca.org'>housing@usca.org</a> and have them
  email you a houselist.  If your house is co-ed, and it's the
  academic year, you will need to upload both lists, for men and
  women, at the same time.  Over the summer, or if your house is
  single-sex, you should get only one such list.  When you upload, you
  will be able to confirm all the deletions and additions that will be
  done.  Make sure you look through them to see that someone isn't
  being deleted just because their name is spelled differently or
  something similar.  Note that if you upload using the CO house
  lists, then your house members' application numbers are stored, so
  that, even if you rename them later, the system can tell that
  they're the same person.  That way, the following semester, you can
  upload the new CO house list, and the system will be able to keep
  track of who is returning just from their application number.

  <li><a name='master_shifts'>
  <h4>Enter workshifts</h4> You need to enter the workshifts your
  house has into the system, along with the days that each shifts is
  done, floors it's done on, etc.  This is a one-time hassle, since
  your shifts probably don't change too much year to year.  You can
  enter them on the usual page, <a
  href='assign_shifts.php'>assign_shifts.php</a>, by clicking on Add
  Row to add a shift, or you can skip the sidebar by using
  <a href='master_shifts.php'>master_shifts.php</a>.  Here are a few
  tips for entering shifts:
  <ul>
  <li>If you have multiple copies of a shift (3 people on dinner crew,
  for example), name the shift the same thing for all of them -- that
  way, that shift will show up once on preference forms, which is what
  you want.  Don't name them Dinner Crew 1, Dinner Crew 2, Dinner Crew
  3.  If there really are different jobs, but they're all basically
  the same shift (done at the same time, for the same hours you can
  put the difference ("pots","dishes","tables") in the "floor" column
  -- sorry the name doesn't make sense.

  <li>Shifts that are not supposed to be assigned (if a bathroom
    isn't cleaned on Saturdays, that shift should remain blank) have
    an XXXXX (or whatever string you set above) in them, and are
    grayed out.  If you do want to assign that shift, just erase the
    XXXXX.

    <li>"Weeklong" means that a shift doesn't have a specific day to
    be done.  If a shift is Weeklong, then almost certainly the other
    columns (for each day) should have an "XXXXX" in them, and vice
    versa, so a shift that has a specific day or days to be done (like
    cooking) should have "XXXXX" in the Weeklong column.  If you put
    something in the Weeklong field, any blank fields will be
    automatically grayed-out.  Likewise, if you put something in a
    non-Weeklong field, if the Weeklong field is blank it will be
    automatically grayed-out.

    <li>The start time and end time give the earliest time this shift
    can be started and the latest time this shift can be ended,
    respectively.  The system uses this to warn you if you try to
    assign someone a shift with a time conflict.

    <li>The category column groups the shifts.  If you're using the
    rating/ranking system of preference forms, members can rank whole
    categories without bothering to rank shifts individually.  As
    well, if a category name starts with a '*', it won't be displayed
    on the preference form, and if it starts with a '**' it won't be
    displayed on the weekly sheets or signoff sheets.

    <li>Don't have any blank rows!  That's a shift with no name, for no
    hours, and just looks silly on preference forms and the like
</ul>

  <li><a name='set_shift_descriptions'><a name='upload_workshift_doc'>
  <h4>Set shift descriptions and workshift docs</h4>You can enter
  shift descriptions and upload a workshift document that people can
  get to from the preference form, at <a
  href='set_shift_descriptions.php'>set_shift_descriptions.php</a> and
  <a href='upload_workshift_doc.php'>upload_workshift_doc.php</a>,
  respectively.  The workshift document will be downloaded directly by
  your members, so make sure it's in a format that they can open.

  <li><h4>Do temp weeks</h4> You probably have a few temp weeks, where
  there aren't permanently assigned shifts.  Go to <a
  href='week.php'>week.php</a> and enter data into the temp week (make
  sure you start at 0) that you're in.  Here are <a
  href='#week'>instructions on doing this</a>.  Once you've created a
  temp week, you can use the button at the top to erase all the names,
  if you don't want them there.
  
  <li><h4>Wait for preference forms</h4> Now sit back, relax, and let
  people submit their workshift preference forms to you.  Remind them
  that they can always go through their <a
  href='../person.php'>personal pages</a> to re-enter information.  If
  they forget what their password is (it's not set until they submit a
  preference form), you can <a href='reset_user_password.php'>reset it</a>
  for them.
  
  <li><h4>Assign workshifts</h4></a> Actually, don't relax too much,
  because it's time to <a href='assign_shifts.php'>assign shifts</a>.
  All submitted data is available to you as it comes, so you can just
  start assigning as it comes (although note that if someone submits
  information while you're assigning shifts, that won't be reflected
  on your page; you'll have to reload it to see the latest info.  Just
  remember to submit your information before you reload!  Also, as the
  pages all say, press control-f5 to get a true reload.  (Macs, sorry,
  I'm not sure what button to press.  Try command-R.)  Your shift
  assignment interface has some <a href='#assign_shifts_features'>cool
  features</a>.
  
  <li><a name='signoff'>After you're done assigning shifts, you may
  want to <a href="master_shifts_print.php">print out the master table
  of workshifts</a>, or <a href="../shifts_by_name.php">print out
  shifts by name</a> (see <a href='#table_print_features'>printing
  tables</a> if you have questions about that).  <li>You can also <a
  href="../public_utils/signoff.php">print out signoff sheets</a> in
  either of two ways, with a weekly grid format, or by day.  If you'd
  like the shifts to be pre-filled-in with the assigned people, make
  sure that box is checked.  If you want a space for the verifier,
  make sure that box is checked.  You can also add extra columns, if
  for some reason you need that, or put a message on the page.</ul>

  <li><a name='week'><h4>Enter weekly data</h4></a> Entering workshift
  data is done through <a href='week.php'>week.php</a>.  Its
  functionality is described in the general <a
  href='#table_edit_features'>table editing features</a>.  Note that
  any changes you make are instantly available to workshifters through
  their personal pages.  If they have questions about whether a shift
  was counted, they should be able to see what shifts you have them as
  doing in their personal pages without bothering you at all.  If you
  are editing a week for the first time, the page will prompt you to
  create the week.  The week will be created from the <a
  href='assign_shifts.php'>currently assigned shifts</a>.<br>  
  At the top of the page, one of two messages may appear.  If you've
  created, but not yet edited, this week, and you've made some changes
  to the shift assignments, you have the option of re-creating this
  sheet from the current assignments.  You might want to do this if,
  for instance, you assign shifts, look at week 3, and then have to
  re-assign a shift because of some change.  If you've already
  modified the sheet, you'll be offered the option of abandoning your
  changes and re-creating the sheet.  If you've already started
  entering data, but you've made a lot of changes, that may be what
  you want to do, but remember: <emph>all</emph> your entered data on
  this sheet will be lost!<p>

  To add a special workshift, add a row for it.  You shouldn't ever
  need to delete rows.  If someone signs out of a shift (in time) and
  no one signs into it, just put a 0 for the hours -- that way,
  they'll have an indication that they signed out of that shift.  If
  someone blows off a shift, make their hours negative (or whatever
  penalty your house uses).  If you'd like to make any notes for that
  shift, enter them here and the member will be able to see them in
  his/her personal page.
  <li>Online signoffs can be enabled at <a
  href='online_signoff_setup.php'>online_signoff_setup.php</a> and
  used at <a href='../online_signoff.php'>online_signoff.php</a>.  You
  can read <a href='#online_signoff_setup'>instructions on setting
  up</a> or <a href='../help.html#online_signoff'>help with signing
  off</a> for more information.  At week.php, if online signoffs are
  available, the following happen.
  <ul><li>Every shift can initially be signed off of online, so the
  online_signoff column will be checked.  To disable online signoff
  for that shift for this week, uncheck the box.
  <li>Once someone signs off of a shift online, the following things
  will happen: the online_signoff field will change to the day and
  time they signed off online.  The system should prevent people from
  signing off of shifts that ended too long ago, but you can check
  that here.  The verifier field will be the person who verified the
  shift.  Finally, the notes field will say ONLINE and any other
  details that are important -- if the online signoff was for a
  different number of hours than usual, the notes field will have the
  original number of hours the shift was worth, and if the shift is
  normally done by a different person, the notes field will say who
  the original person was.
  <li>If you want to change the fields for someone who signed off
  online, go ahead and do that -- they're just the same as normal
  shift entries now.
  </ul>

  <li><a name='weekly_totals_print'>
  <a name='weekly_totals_update'>
<h4>Weekly totals</h4> Finally, there are pages for <a
  href='weekly_totals_update.php'>updating the weekly totals</a>, <a
  href='weekly_totals_print.php'>printing the weekly totals</a>, <a
  href='house_fines.php'>printing and downloading the fines</a>, and <a
  href='weekly_totals_consts.php'>setting constants associated with
  the weekly totals</a>.

<ul><li>By default, when updating and printing the weekly totals, just
    the last two week's total hours done and hours owed are displayed,
    but you can check and uncheck the columns to make it look the way
    you want.  As well, if any fining periods have occurred, the fines
    for those fining periods are displayed, along with any other
    fines, to make the total fines.  If your house has weekly fines,
    those are included in Other Fines.
    <li>When updating, you can change the number of hours owed for any
    given person on any given day.  The totals update automatically,
    but you still need to submit your data.  All the <a
    href='#table_edit_features'>table editing features</a> are
    available here.

<p>If someone in your house owes
    a different number of hours every week (for instance, they're a
    boarder), choose their name at the top, enter the number of hours
    they owe every week, and press the button to change their owed
    hours.  Their owed hours will be changed for the whole semester.
    However, the system assumes that if, for some week, that person
    didn't owe the default number of hours owed (usually 5), then
    maybe you had some reason for setting it that way (maybe it was
    move-in week, and everyone owed only 1 hour), so it won't change
    those weeks, unless you check the checkbox to make it.<br>

    Similarly, if there's a week where the default number of hours
    owed is different (spring break, move-in, etc.), enter the
    starting and ending weeks for the different hours owed at the top
    of the page, and click the button (by default the ending week is
    the starting week).

    <li>You can check out <a href='#table_print_features'>table
    printing features</a> for the printing.

    <li><a name='house_fines'>The house fines page gives a
    week-by-week breakdown of the fines for every week and fining
    period for all your members.  At the top of the page is a link to
    download this page to Excel, and also an option to view the fines
    for a past semester (if there's a dispute and you need to view old
    fines).

    <li><a name='weekly_totals_consts'>Setting your house's fining
    parameters can be confusing.  Please <a
    href='mailto:janak@berkeley.edu'>email me</a> if something isn't
    clear or if you think an option is missing.

    <ul><li>Setting the fining period info and other miscellaneous
    features is something that you should only have to do at the
    beginning of the semester, or if you change a fining period.

    <li>You can set the current week, which will make the system
    ignore what it thinks the current week is, and use your week.
    Remember to delete this once the reason for tricking the system is
    finished (i.e., once you've caught up).  Note that if you haven't
    yet <a href='week.php'>edited the sheet</a> for some week, the
    system will assume that that week hasn't happened yet.  This means
    that if you've fallen behind, the system automatically won't
    advance in the weeks it displays until you've caught up, so you
    shouldn't actually ever need to set the current week.

    <li>Your house may have the possibility of fining members every
    week, even during weeks that don't end fining periods.  If so, you
    should check the weekly fining box.

    <ul>Here is a list of the various parameters you can set inside
    each week or fining period.  After this list are the explanations
    of the other features.

    <li>The fining rate is set by CO.  If, for some reason, you want a
    particular fining period to have a different fining rate from the
    standard one (this should never happen), you can set it
    individually in that fining period.

    <li>The fining floor is the baseline for fines: if it is 3, then
    someone who is down 4 hours is fined 1 hour, because they are 1
    hour below the floor.

    <li>The buffer is the amount people can be below the floor before
    fines kick in.  If the buffer is 2 and the floor is still 3, then
    someone down 5 hours is not fined, because they are 2 hours below,
    and since the buffer is 2, they have to be more than 2 hours below
    to be fined.  However, if someone is down 6 hours, they are fined
    for 3 hours, because the buffer does not protect them, and they
    are 3 hours below the floor.  In Stebbins, on fining weeks the
    floor is 0 and the buffer is 2 (you're fined for all your
    negative hours, unless you're less than 2 hours below 0).  By CO
    policy, the buffer at the end of the semester must be 0.  In
    Stebbins, on non-fining weeks people who are more than 10 hours
    below 0 are fined for each of those hours.  For those weeks, the
    floor is 10 (you must be 10 below 0 to be fined), and the buffer
    is 0 (you're fined for every hour below 10).

    <li>The double-fining floor is the level below which a member's
    hours are double-fined.  For example, if the floor is 0, the
    buffer is 0, and the double-fining floor is 3, then if a member is
    down 7 hours, they will be fined for 3 + 4*2=11 hours, because
    they are fined one hour's worth for each hour below the fining
    floor, and then again for each hour below the double-fining floor.

    <li>Many houses say that if a member has paid a fine for down
    hours, the member no longer has to make up those hours.  If that
    is your house's policy, check that box for every time it applies
    (in the unlikely event that you zero hours every week, check the
    box there, and otherwise, check it for the fining periods at which
    hours are zeroed).  If your house only partially zeroes hours,
    then <a href='#zero_partial'>see below</a>.
    </ul>

    <li>Many houses say that a member cannot be up more than some
    number of hours (in Stebbins, it's 10).  If your house has that
    policy, enter that number for the maximum number of hours a member
    can be up.  Note that if your house doesn't have a max, make sure
    this field is blank.

    <li>For some houses, there is a different number of hours that a
    member can be up at the end of a fining period.  CZ, for example,
    put people with up hours back down to 0, so the maximum would be 0
    here.  Hoyt might have 5 here and nothing elsewhere.  As with
    above, make sure this field is blank (not zero) if this doesn't
    apply to you.

    <li><a name='cash_hours_auto'>Stebbins</a>, and possibly some
    other houses, allow members to pay off workshift fines with up
    hours.  If someone has been fined 3 workshift hours over the
    course of the semester, and they end the semester up 3 hours, then
    they can apply those up hours towards the fine, so they don't have
    pay it.  As well, if there is a maximum number of hours that
    someone can be up, if they ever go over that amount, those extra
    hours will be applied towards fines, if any, that the member has
    already incurred.  <!-- You can also <a href='fining_data.php'>manually
    cash-in hours</a>, but this will take care of things
    automatically. -->

    <li>Hoyt may be the only house like this: if people can pay off
    down hours with fines, but their down hours are still kept track
    of, then you should check the box to keep a tally of hours without
    zeroing.

    <li>Wilde has a policy where not all of the down hours are fined
    -- only some percentage.  If someone is down 5 hours, but they are
    only fined for 3 of them, then this number should be 60, that is
    60% of 5.

    <li><a name='zero_partial'>Wilde has a policy where not all of the
    down hours are zeroed after a fining period.  If someone who is
    down 8 hours at the end of a fining period is still down 6 hours
    after "zeroing," then this number should be 75, that is 75% of
    their original down hours are still there.

    </ul>
    </ul> 
    </ul> 
    <li><h3>Features of tables in the
    system</h3> <ul>

  <li><a name='table_edit_features'><h4>Table editing features</h4></a>
  The table editing interface is meant to be as spreadsheet-like
  as possible, for ease of entry.  Here are some of the features:
  <ul>

    <li>down- and up-arrows move to the next and previous rows, and
    page-up and page-down, move 15 rows up and down.  Enter moves to
    the first element of the next row, while Tab moves to the next
    element.  Shift-Enter and Shift-Tab do the appropriate reversals.
    Control-Home and Control-End go to the top and bottom of the page.

    <li>When entering a member name, there is auto-completion.  You
    should be able to enter just the first few letters, and the name
    will be completed.  If the correct name is not being suggested,
    keep typing until it is.

    <li>If you enter a name not in the database, the page will warn
    you, although you will be permitted to make the entry.

    <li>Edited cells are shown in red.  If you delete a row, it
    is shown in blue.

    <li>If you wish to see only rows with a specific person, you can
    either choose their name from the drop-down box at the top of the
    page, or press control-e while you are editing an input box with
    their name in it.  Either way, press control-e to undo and see
    everyone again.


    <li>In some tables, you can sort the table by the values of a
    column.  Currently, you must save the table first before sorting
    it.  If you wish to sort by multiple columns, first sort by the
    less important column, then by the more important.  Clicking on a
    column name twice will sort it in the opposite direction.

    <li>If you want to see only certain columns, uncheck the columns
    you wish to hide at the top of the page.  You can also click on
    Show none or Show all and then choose (or unchoose) a few columns,
    if that is easier.  When you unclick Show none or Show all, you'll
    be back to the original page.
  
    <li>To add a new row, press Add Row at the bottom of the page.  To
    delete a row, check the Delete box.

    <li>You must save your data when you are done.  When you are first
    using this system, I recommend frequent saves to avoid losing data
    in case there's a problem.  To save, press the left-hand button at
    the top of the page, or press Control-s.  The status message at
    the top of the page should change to say Table updated!  If it
    does not, or if the cells remain red/blue, or if an error message
    box comes back, you may have a problem.  Remain calm.  One thing
    you should do is print this page out (saving it to your hard disk
    may not do much good).  Try submitting it again, using the
    left-hand button.  If things still aren't working, <a
    href='mailto:janak@berkeley.edu'>contact me</a>.  Finally, you can
    click on the button Update database without Javascript.  It's
    actually quite safe, but if for some reason it doesn't work, then
    your data may not be there when you press the back button on your
    browser.  </ul>

  <li><a name='assign_shifts_features'><h4>Assigning shifts features</h4></a>
  <ul>
  
    <li>Remember to look above at the <a href='#master_shifts'>format
    for entering shifts</a>.

    <li>The spreadsheet part of the page has the same features as all
    of the <a href='#table_edit_features'>table editing features</a>.

    <li>The left-hand pane shows the house list, with the number of
    hours each person currently has assigned.  If you double-click on
    a person's name, a separate window comes up with their preference
    form.  If the window that comes up is too big, resize it and leave
    it alone -- all future clicks will open in the same window, which
    will be the right size now.

    <li>When you click into a text box to enter a person for a shift,
    in the left-hand pane people who can't do that shift, either
    because they have too many hours, they have a time conflict, or
    they requested not to have that shift, are displayed in grey, with
    a small font, and their names crossed out.  In blue is the person
    currently assigned to the shift, in bold are the people who have
    requested that shift.  If your house has a rating system, the
    greener and larger someone's name is, the higher the rating they
    gave to the shift.

    <li>The left-hand pane can be sorted according to various
    criteria.  The arrow can be used to reverse the current sort.  In
    the case of a tie, the previous sort that you chose is used, so if
    you choose name, and then you choose hours, it will sort by how
    many hours are assigned, and among people with the same number of
    hours assigned, it will sort by name.  The default is name.  The
    others are points, date submitted, wanted, and hours.  Points is
    only meaningful if you uploaded the house list given to you by CO.
    If for some reason your house gives priority in shift assignment
    to people with lots of points, this can be useful to you.  Date
    submitted sorts by the date/time people submitted their preference
    forms.  The last submission by a member overrides earlier
    submission dates by that member.  Wanted sorts members by their
    desire to do the shift you're currently focused on in the other
    pane.  You also see this with the above feature of bolding, etc.,
    but this may be useful too.  Finally, hours sorts by the number of
    hours assigned to the person.

    <li>If you assign a person to a shift they can't do, for whatever
    reason, the page will warn you, although you can still assign it.
    If it's due to a time conflict with an unwanted time, the system
    will tell you that, and if it's because of a busy time, the system
    will tell you that.  It will not warn you if you assign to a time
    the member has put a question mark next to.  <a
    href='mailto:janak@berkeley.edu'>Let me</a> know if you would like
    that.
  </ul>

  <li><a name='table_print_features'><h4>Table printing features</h4>
  Printing tables is much like <a href='#table_edit_features'>editing
  them</a>.  Check and uncheck the columns until the page looks the
  way you want.  Then click on the print button to remove extraneous
  options and bring up a print dialog.  You can cancel the dialog if
  you wish, and print later.  However, to get back the cute features
  at the top of the page, you'll need to reload the page.  There may
  be bugs with how columns are displayed.  Try hiding the browser
  window and then bringing it up again, or resizing the window, if
  that happens.

  <li><a name='#escape_sequences'>Some parts of the site will allow
  you to enter some text that users will see.  Often that text may
  have parts which are not fixed -- the user's name, for instance, or
  the current week.  When that happens, there should be a line that
  says something like "(You can use the following escape codes to
  insert data into this text: %current_week will insert the Current
  week)".  When you see this, you know that if, in your text, you put
  "This week is week %current_week," then the user will see "This week
  is week 7," in the 7th week.  Remember to put the escape code in
  exactly as it's written.

</ul>
<h3>Miscellaneous Tasks</h3>

<ul><li><a name='#person.admin'>If a member comes to you with a
question about their shifts, you can <a href='person.admin.php'>view
their personal page</a>, with all their data.  Each week has a line
giving exactly what happened that week with hours, fines, etc.  The
current week, which hasn't finished yet, is shown at the bottom, but
its totals are not included in the totals at the top of the page.

<li><a name='fining_data'>If there is a fine coming from outside the
system (for a blown bathroom clean, or the like), you can <a
href='fining_data.php'>enter it</a> and it will be added to their
fines.  Enter the date in m/d format (so June 22 is 6/22).

<li><a name='#special_fining'>Sometimes a member will have a fining
period end at a different week than the rest of the house.  This page
allows you to set that up.  -1 indicates that the fining period takes
place the same week as the rest of the house.  Leaving it blank means
that this fining period is cancelled for this member.  Entering
another week means that this fining period will take effect for this
member at the end of that week.

</ul>

<a name='advanced_tasks'><h3>Advanced Tasks</h3>
<ul>

  <li><a href='backup_database.php'>Backup your database</a>
  frequently.  This means that if you accidentally delete a week's
  shifts, or do something else really stupid, you can <a
  href='recover_database.php'>recover the database</a>.  Every so
  often, you might want to <a href='delete_backup_database.php'>delete
  an old backup if it's definitely not useful anymore</a>.

  <li><a href='change_password.php'>Change your password</a>.  If you
  need to change your password (maybe you're a new workshift manager
  and you don't want the old workshift manager to have access to the
  files), you can change your password.  This mainly affects the
  prompt you get when you first go to the workshift admin pages.  Make
  sure that you are <b>not editing any tables</b> when you change your
  password -- you won't be able to save them!

  <li><a name='view_backup'>You can <a
  href='../public_utils/weekly_totals_print.php?getarchive'>print out
  the weekly totals of a backed-up database</a>, or even <a
  href='weekly_totals_update.php?getarchive'>edit the hours owed or
  notes for a backed-up database</a>.  <a href='house_fines.php'>House
  fines</a> are also available.  Very useful if you need to see what
  someone's fines were at the end of a previous semester.  If
  necessary, you can also <a
  href='recover_backup_database.php'>recover a back up</a> if you need
  to.

  <li><a href='table_edit.wrapper.wrapper.php'>View or edit a
  table</a> if for some reason you need direct access to a table.  You
  should never have to use this option -- please email <a
  href='mailto:janak@berkeley.edu'>janak@berkeley.edu</a> if you do.
