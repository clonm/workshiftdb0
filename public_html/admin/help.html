<ul>

<li><h3>Tasks you can do, and the order you should do them in</h3> 

The <b>first thing</b> you have to do is make sure you can view <a
href='index.php'>your front page</a>, using whatever username and
password were specified by your administrator (the default is
(three-letter-house-code)workshift for both the username and password,
like stbworkshift for Stebbins).  Your front page has links to
everything mentioned here.  Make sure you can log in to it.  If you
can't, then the password has been changed.  Contact the old workshift
manager and find out what it is.  If you can't get in touch with them,
the <a href='mailto:workshiftadmin@gmail.com'>workshift
administrator</a> can reset the password.

<ul>

  <li><a name='basic_consts'><h4>Set basic constants</h4> Go to <a
  href='basic_consts.php'>basic_consts.php</a> to set some basic
  parameters, like when the semester started and when preferences
  forms are due.

<ul><li>
  Since this page can change a lot of things, it backs up your system
  before it does anything, so that the old system can be completely
  restored if necessary.  If you want to give a name to this backup,
  enter it in the box -- otherwise, it will just use the current date
  and time so that if you need to restore a backup, you know exactly
  when it is from.

  <li>The "start of the semester" section is for cleaning up previous
  semesters' data.  The first box deletes members' preference forms.
  Some members may have preferences that haven't changed much, but if
  you don't delete them, you may be misled about their availability,
  so it's probably a good idea to delete them.  The next box deletes
  the assigned shifts, so that when you're assigning shifts, you're
  starting from a blank slate.  Definitely don't check it until the
  previous semester ends, because otherwise the shift assignments will
  be lost.  The third and final box should only be checked when the
  next semester has started, and everything from the previous semester
  has finished, i.e., all workshift entries have finished, fines have
  been calculated, etc.  The old semester is still available for
  viewing through various <a href='view_backup'>archive methods</a> or
  restoring, if it turns out that it didn't actually end.

  <li>The preference forms are set up here, because you need to get
  them ready right away for your house.

  <ul><li>The preference forms can either let users choose shifts that
  they want and shifts that they don't want, or it can let users
  rate/rank categories of shifts.  Choose which you prefer here.  Note
  that if you want the rating/ranking system, you are going to have to
  <a href='assign_shifts.php'>enter a category for each shift</a> or
  your members will have to rate every single one of your shifts,
  since each will be in its own category.  (Note that on the
  assign_shifts page, if you put a single * in the category, the
  system will treat this as a special shift, and will not put it on
  the preference form.  If you put **, the system will also not put it
  in signoff sheets or weekly sheets.)
  
  <li>If you don't enter the preferences due date and shifts start
  date, <a href='../preferences.php'>preferences.php</a> will look
  silly.  You can also change the text that appears on the preferences
  page.  The first textbox contains the text which goes at the top of
  the form.  The second contains the text right before where the
  members will enter their shift preferences.  There are a few options
  you can choose about these.  If you would like this text to be
  rendered as html (so things like &lt;strong&gt; make things strong,
  and you can put links in, etc.), then check the box.  Otherwise
  uncheck it.  Remember that if it's html, to make a line break, you
  have to put in &lt;br&gt; or &lt;p&gt;, not just press the "enter"
  key.  The second thing you can do is put in <a
  href='#escape_sequences'>escape sequences</a>.  If you're using the
  wanted/unwanted style for shift preferences, there are no escape
  sequences for that text, but otherwise, read the instructions.
  </ul>

  <li>The houselist question is so that the system can deal with the
  houselists that CO sends you, that you can <a
  href='update_house.php'>upload</a> to set the house list.<br>

</ul>
<li><a name='update_house'><h4>Enter house list</h4> You need to have
  a house list entered.  You can do that at <a
  href='update_house.php'>update_house.php</a>.  Make sure every
  member's name you enter is unique.  Try to enter them in a
  consistent format, like Lastname, Firstname (what Stebbins does),
  LastNameFirstname, or whatever.  Just keep it consistent.  Since
  there is auto-completion on most of the pages, don't worry too much
  about length of names -- you won't have to type the whole thing in
  every time.  The best way to do this is to email <a
  href='mailto:housing@usca.org'>housing@usca.org</a> and have them
  email you a houselist.  If your house is co-ed, and it's the
  academic year, you will need to upload both lists, for men and
  women, at the same time.  Over the summer, or if your house is
  single-sex, you should get only one such list.  When you upload, you
  will be able to confirm all the deletions and additions that will be
  done.  Make sure you look through them to see that someone isn't
  being deleted just because their name is spelled differently or
  something similar.<br/>

  There is other <a href='#update_house_more'>important information on
  updating the house list</a>.  Please check it out.

  <li><a name='master_shifts'> <h4>Enter workshifts</h4> You need to
  enter the workshifts your house has into the system, along with the
  days that each shifts is done, floors it's done on, etc.  This is a
  one-time hassle, since your shifts probably don't change too much
  year to year.  You can enter them on the usual page, <a
  href='assign_shifts.php'>assign_shifts.php</a>, by clicking on Add
  Row to add a shift, or you can skip the sidebar by using <a
  href='master_shifts.php'>master_shifts.php</a>.  (If you're here
  because you're having trouble assigning shifts, <a
  href='#assign_shifts_features'>check out the help</a> for that.)  Here are a
  few tips for entering shifts: <ul> <li>If you have multiple copies
  of a shift (3 people on dinner crew, for example), name the shift
  the same thing for all of them -- that way, that shift will show up
  once on preference forms, which is what you want.  Don't name them
  Dinner Crew 1, Dinner Crew 2, Dinner Crew 3.  If there really are
  different jobs, but they're all basically the same shift (done at
  the same time, for the same hours you can put the difference
  ("pots","dishes","tables") in the "floor" column -- sorry the name
  doesn't make sense.

  <li>Shifts that are not supposed to be assigned (if a bathroom
    isn't cleaned on Saturdays, that shift should remain blank) have
    an XXXXX (or whatever string you set above) in them, and are
    grayed out.  If you do want to assign that shift, just erase the
    XXXXX.

    <li>"Weeklong" means that a shift doesn't have a specific day to
    be done.  If a shift is Weeklong, then almost certainly the other
    columns (for each day) should have an "XXXXX" in them, and vice
    versa, so a shift that has a specific day or days to be done (like
    cooking) should have "XXXXX" in the Weeklong column.  If you put
    something in the Weeklong field, any blank fields will be
    automatically grayed-out.  Likewise, if you put something in a
    non-Weeklong field, if the Weeklong field is blank it will be
    automatically grayed-out.

    <li>The start time and end time give the earliest time this shift
    can be started and the latest time this shift can be ended,
    respectively.  The system uses this to warn you if you try to
    assign someone a shift with a time conflict.

    <li>The category column groups the shifts.  If you're using the
    rating/ranking system of preference forms, members can rank whole
    categories without bothering to rank shifts individually.  As
    well, if a category name starts with a '*', it won't be displayed
    on the preference form, and if it starts with a '**' it won't be
    displayed on the weekly sheets or signoff sheets.  (You can use
    this to avoid having manager positions show up on weekly signoffs
    or in preference forms.)

    <li>Don't have any blank rows!  That's a shift with no name, for no
    hours, and just looks silly on preference forms and the like
</ul>

  <li><a name='set_shift_descriptions'><a name='upload_workshift_doc'>
  <h4>Set shift descriptions and workshift docs</h4></a></a>You can enter
  shift descriptions and upload a workshift document that people can
  get to from the preference form, at <a
  href='set_shift_descriptions.php'>set_shift_descriptions.php</a> and
  <a href='upload_workshift_doc.php'>upload_workshift_doc.php</a>,
  respectively.  The workshift document will be downloaded directly by
  your members, so make sure it's in a format that they can open.

  <li><h4>Set up online signoffs, if you want them.</h4>You can enable
  online signoffs, at <a
  href='online_signoff_setup.php'>online_signoff_setup.php</a>.  <a
  href='#online_signoff_setup'>Read more</a> about it.

  <li><h4>Do temp weeks</h4> You probably have a few temp weeks, where
  there aren't permanently assigned shifts.  Go to <a
  href='week.php'>week.php</a> and enter data into the temp week (make
  sure you start at 0) that you're in.  Here are <a
  href='#week'>instructions on doing this</a>.  Once you've created a
  temp week, you can use the button at the top to erase all the names,
  if you don't want them there.
  
  <li><h4>Wait for preference forms</h4> Now sit back, relax, and let
  people submit their workshift preference forms to you.  Remind them
  that they can always go through their <a
  href='../person.php'>personal pages</a> to re-enter information.  If
  they forget what their password is (it's not set until they submit a
  preference form), you can <a href='reset_user_password.php'>reset it</a>
  for them.
  
  <li><h4>Assign workshifts</h4> Actually,
  don't relax too much, because it's time to <a
  href='assign_shifts.php'>assign shifts</a>.  All submitted data is
  available to you as it comes, so you can just start assigning as it
  comes (although note that if someone submits information while
  you're assigning shifts, that won't be reflected on your page;
  you'll have to reload it to see the latest info.  Just remember to
  submit your information before you reload!  Also, as the pages all
  say, press control-f5 to get a true reload.  (Macs, sorry, I'm not
  sure what button to press.  Try command-R.)  Your shift assignment
  interface has some <a href='#assign_shifts_features'>cool
  features</a>.
  
  <li><a name='first_signoff'>After you're done assigning shifts, you may
  want to <a href="master_shifts_print.php">print out the master table
  of workshifts</a>, or <a href="../shifts_by_name.php">print out
  shifts by name</a> (see <a href='#table_print_features'>printing
  tables</a> if you have questions about that).  <li>You can also <a
  href="../public_utils/signoff.php">print out signoff sheets</a> in
  either of two ways, with a weekly grid format, or by day.  If you'd
  like the shifts to be pre-filled-in with the assigned people, make
  sure that box is checked.  If you want a space for the verifier,
  make sure that box is checked.  You can also add extra columns, if
  for some reason you need that, or put a message on the page. <a
  href='#signoff'>See more help</a> on signoffs.</ul>

  <li><a name='week'><h4>Enter weekly data</h4></a> Entering workshift
  data is done through <a href='week.php'>week.php</a>.  Its
  functionality is described in the general <a
  href='#table_edit_features'>table editing features</a>.

  <ul><li>Note that any changes you make are instantly available to
  workshifters through their personal pages.  If they have questions
  about whether a shift was counted, they should be able to see what
  shifts you have them as doing in their personal pages without
  bothering you at all.

  <li>If you are editing a week for the first time, the page will
  prompt you to create the week.  The week will be created from the <a
  href='assign_shifts.php'>currently assigned shifts</a>.<br> At the
  top of the page, one of two messages may appear.  If you've created,
  but not yet edited, this week, and you've made some changes to the
  shift assignments, you have the option of re-creating this sheet
  from the current assignments.  You might want to do this if, for
  instance, you assign shifts, look at week 3 (but don't edit it), and
  then later have to re-assign a shift because of some change.  If
  you've already modified the sheet, you'll be offered the option of
  abandoning your changes and re-creating the sheet.  If you've
  already started entering data, but you've made a lot of changes,
  that may be what you want to do, but remember: <emph>all</emph> your
  entered data on this sheet will be lost!

  <li>To add a special workshift, add a row for it.  You shouldn't
  ever need to delete rows.  When you add the shift, if you enter the
  day, the date should be filled-in automatically.

  <li>If someone signs out of a shift (in time) and no one signs into
  it, just put a 0 for the hours -- that way, they'll have an
  indication that they signed out of that shift.  If someone blows off
  a shift, make their hours negative (or whatever penalty your house
  uses).  If you'd like to make any notes for that shift, enter them
  here and the member will be able to see them in his/her personal
  page.

  <li><a name='online_signoff_running'>Online</a> signoffs can be enabled at <a
  href='online_signoff_setup.php'>online_signoff_setup.php</a> and
  used at <a href='../online_signoff.php'>online_signoff.php</a>.  You
  can read <a href='#online_signoff_setup'>instructions on setting
  up</a> or <a href='../help.html#online_signoff'>help with signing
  off</a> for more information.  At week.php, if online signoffs are
  available, the following things happen: <ul><li>Every shift can
  initially be signed off of online, so the online_signoff column will
  be checked.  To disable online signoff for that shift for this week,
  uncheck the box.  <li>Once someone signs off of a shift online, the
  following things will happen: the online_signoff field will change
  to the day and time they signed off online.  The system should
  prevent people from signing off of shifts that ended too long ago,
  but you can check that here.  The verifier field will be the person
  who verified the shift.  Finally, the notes field will say ONLINE
  and any other details that are important -- if the online signoff
  was for a different number of hours than usual, the notes field will
  have the original number of hours the shift was worth, and if the
  shift is normally done by a different person, the notes field will
  say who the original person was.  <li>If you want to change the
  fields for someone who signed off online, go ahead and do that --
  they're just the same as normal shift entries now.  </ul>

  <li><a name='weekly_totals_print'>
  <a name='weekly_totals_update'>
<h4>Weekly totals</h4> Finally, there are pages for <a
  href='weekly_totals_update.php'>updating the weekly totals</a>, <a
  href='weekly_totals_print.php'>printing the weekly totals</a>, <a
  href='house_fines.php'>printing and downloading the fines</a>, and <a
  href='weekly_totals_consts.php'>setting constants associated with
  the weekly totals</a>.

<ul><li>By default, when updating and printing the weekly totals, just
    the last two weeks' total hours done and hours owed are displayed,
    but you can check and uncheck the columns to make it look the way
    you want.  As well, if any fining periods have occurred, the fines
    for those fining periods are displayed, along with any other
    fines, to make the total fines.  If your house has weekly fines,
    those are included in Other Fines.  

    <li>At the <a
    href='../public_utils/weekly_totals_print.php'>weekly totals
    print</a> and <a href='../weekly_totals.php'>weekly totals</a>
    pages, the weeks that each person was fined on will be
    automatically appended to their notes, so it's easy to see at a
    glance for a member when they've been fined.
    
    <li><a name='house_fines'>The house fines page gives a
    week-by-week breakdown of the fines for every week and fining
    period for all your members.  At the top of the page is a link to
    download this page to Excel, and also an option to view the fines
    for a past semester (if there's a dispute and you need to view old
    fines).

    <li>When updating, you can change the number of hours owed for any
    given person on any given day.  The totals update automatically,
    but you still need to submit your data.  All the <a
    href='#table_edit_features'>table editing features</a> are
    available here.

<p>If someone in your house usually owes a different number of hours
    than normal (for instance, they're a boarder), choose their name
    at the top, enter the number of hours they owe every week, choose
    the weeks for which to change their hours, and press the button
    "Change person" to change their owed hours.  Their owed hours will
    be changed for the entire week range.  However, the system assumes
    that if, for some week, that person didn't owe the default number
    of hours owed (usually 5), then maybe you had some reason for
    setting it that way (maybe it was move-in week, and everyone owed
    only 1 hour), so it won't change those weeks, unless you check the
    checkbox to make it.<br/>

    Similarly, if there's a week where the default number of hours
    owed is different (spring break, move-in, etc.), enter the
    starting and ending weeks for the different hours owed at the top
    of the page, and click the button (by default the ending week is
    the starting week).

    <li>You can check out <a href='#table_print_features'>table
    printing features</a> for the printing.

    <li><a name='weekly_totals_consts'>Setting your house's fining
    parameters can be confusing.  Please <a
    href='mailto:janak@berkeley.edu'>email me</a> if something isn't
    clear or if you think an option is missing.

    <ul><li>Setting the fining period info and other miscellaneous
    features is something that you should only have to do at the
    beginning of the semester, or if you change a fining period.

    <li>You can set the current week, which will make the system
    ignore what it thinks the current week is, and use your week.
    Remember to delete this once the reason for tricking the system is
    finished (i.e., once you've caught up, or seen what things will
    look like at the end of this week).  Note that if you haven't yet
    <a href='week.php'>edited the sheet</a> for some week, the system
    will assume that that week hasn't happened yet.  This means that
    if you've fallen behind, the system automatically won't advance in
    the weeks it displays until you've caught up, so you shouldn't
    actually ever need to set the current week if you fall behind.

    <li>The fining rate is set by CO.  Just enter it in here.  Scaling
    it as per your house fining policy will be set up below.

    <li>Your house may have the possibility of fining members every
    week, even during weeks that don't end fining periods.  If so, you
    should check the weekly fining box.

    <ul>Here is a list of the various parameters you can set inside
    each week or fining period.  After this list are the explanations
    of the other features.

    <li>The fining floor is the baseline for fines: if it is 3, then
    someone who is down 4 hours is fined 1 hour, because they are 1
    hour below the floor.

    <li>The buffer is the amount people can be below the floor before
    fines kick in.  If the buffer is 2 and the floor is still 3, then
    someone down 5 hours is not fined, because they are 2 hours below
    the floor, and since the buffer is 2, they have to be more than 2
    hours below to be fined.  However, if someone is down 6 hours,
    they are fined for 3 hours, because the buffer does not protect
    them, and they are 3 hours below the floor.  In Stebbins, on
    fining weeks the floor is 0 and the buffer is 2 (you're fined for
    all your negative hours, unless you're less than 2 hours below 0).
    By CO policy, the buffer at the end of the semester must be 0.  In
    Stebbins, on non-fining weeks people who are more than 10 hours
    below 0 are fined for each of those hours.  For those weeks, the
    floor is 10 (you must be 10 below 0 to be fined), and the buffer
    is 0 (you're fined for every hour below 10).

    <li>The double-fining floor is the level below which a member's
    hours are double-fined.  For example, if the floor is 0, the
    buffer is 0, and the double-fining floor is 3, then if a member is
    down 7 hours, they will be fined for 3 + 4*2=11 hours, because
    they are fined one hour's worth for each hour below the fining
    floor, and then again for each hour below the double-fining floor.

    <li>Many houses say that if a member has paid a fine for down
    hours, the member no longer has to make up those hours.  If that
    is your house's policy, check that box for every time it applies
    (in the unlikely event that you zero hours every week, check the
    box there, and otherwise, check it for the fining periods at which
    hours are zeroed).  If your house only partially zeroes hours,
    then <a href='#zero_partial'>see below</a>.
    </ul>

    <li>Many houses say that a member cannot be up more than some
    number of hours (in Stebbins, it's 10).  If your house has that
    policy, enter that number for the maximum number of hours a member
    can be up.  Note that if your house doesn't have a max, make sure
    this field is blank.

    <li>For some houses, there is a different number of hours that a
    member can be up at the end of a fining period.  CZ, for example,
    put people with up hours back down to 0, so the maximum would be 0
    here.  Hoyt might have 5 here and nothing elsewhere.  As with
    above, make sure this field is blank (not '0', but totally blank)
    if this doesn't apply to you.

    <li><a name='cash_hours_auto'>Stebbins</a>, and possibly some
    other houses, allow members to pay off workshift fines with up
    hours.  If someone has been fined 3 workshift hours over the
    course of the semester, and they end the semester up 3 hours, then
    they can apply those up hours towards the fine, so they don't have
    pay it.  As well, if there is a maximum number of hours that
    someone can be up, if they ever go over that amount, those extra
    hours will be applied towards fines, if any, that the member has
    already incurred.  <!-- You can also <a href='fining_data.php'>manually
    cash-in hours</a>, but this will take care of things
    automatically. -->

    <li>Hoyt may be the only house like this: if people can pay off
    down hours with fines, but their down hours are still kept track
    of, then you should check the box to keep a tally of hours without
    zeroing.

    <li>Wilde has a policy where not all of the down hours are fined
    -- only some percentage.  If someone is down 5 hours, but they are
    only fined for 3 of them, then this number should be 60, that is
    60% of 5.

    <li><a name='zero_partial'>Wilde has a policy where not all of the
    down hours are zeroed after a fining period.  If someone who is
    down 8 hours at the end of a fining period is still down 6 hours
    after "zeroing," then this number should be 75, that is 75% of
    their original down hours are still there.  Note that you still
    need to check the "zero hours" checkbox in order to have this
    partial zeroing applied.

    </ul>
    </ul> 
    </ul> 
    <li><h3>Features of tables in the
    system</h3> <ul>

  <li><a name='table_edit_features'><h4>Table editing features</h4></a>
  The table editing interface is meant to be as spreadsheet-like
  as possible, for ease of entry.  Here are some of the features:
  <ul>

    <li>down- and up-arrows move to the next and previous rows, and
    page-up and page-down, move 15 rows up and down.  Enter moves to
    the first element of the next row, while Tab moves to the next
    element.  Shift-Enter and Shift-Tab do the appropriate reversals.
    Control-Home and Control-End go to the top and bottom of the page.

    <li>When entering a member name, there is auto-completion.  You
    should be able to enter just the first few letters, and the name
    will be completed.  If the correct name is not being suggested,
    keep typing until it is.

    <li>If you enter a name not in the database, the page will warn
    you, although you will be permitted to make the entry.

    <li>Edited cells are shown in red.  If you delete a row, it
    is shown in blue.

    <li>For ease of reading, rows are colored in groups of three,
    turquoise and white.  If you want to turn that coloring off
    (perhaps for printing), uncheck the "Color rows?" box.

    <li>If you wish to see only rows with a specific person, you can
    either choose their name from the drop-down box at the top of the
    page, or press control-e while you are editing an input box with
    their name in it.  Either way, press control-e to undo and see
    everyone again.


    <li>In some tables, you can sort the table by the values of a
    column.  Currently, you must save the table first before sorting
    it.  If you wish to sort by multiple columns, first sort by the
    less important column, then by the more important.  Clicking on a
    column name twice will sort it in the opposite direction.

    <li>If you want to see only certain columns, uncheck the columns
    you wish to hide at the top of the page.  You can also click on
    Show none or Show all and then choose (or unchoose) a few columns,
    if that is easier.  When you unclick Show none or Show all, you'll
    be back to the original setup.
  
    <li>To add a new row, press Add Row at the bottom of the page.  To
    delete a row, check the Delete box.

    <li>You must save your data when you are done.  When you are first
    using this system, I recommend frequent saves to avoid losing data
    in case there's a problem.  To save, press the left-hand button at
    the top of the page, or press Control-s.  The status message at
    the top of the page should change to say Table updated!  If it
    does not, or if the cells remain red/blue, or if an error message
    box comes back, you may have a problem.  Remain calm.  One thing
    you should do is print this page out (saving it to your hard disk
    may not do much good).  Try submitting it again, using the
    left-hand button.  If things still aren't working, <a
    href='mailto:janak@berkeley.edu'>contact me</a>.  Finally, you can
    click on the button Update database without Javascript.  It's
    actually quite safe, but if for some reason it doesn't work, then
    your data may not be there when you press the back button on your
    browser.  </ul>

  <li><a name='assign_shifts_features'><h4>Assigning shifts features</h4></a>
  <ul>
  
    <li>Remember to look above at the <a href='#master_shifts'>format
    for entering shifts</a>.

    <li>The spreadsheet part of the page has the same features as all
    of the <a href='#table_edit_features'>table editing features</a>.

    <li>The left-hand pane shows the house list, with the number of
    hours each person currently has assigned.  If you double-click on
    a person's name, a separate window comes up with their preference
    form.  If the window that comes up is too big, resize it and leave
    it alone -- all future clicks will open in the same window, which
    will be the right size now.

    <li>When you click into a text box to enter a person for a shift,
    in the left-hand pane people who can't do that shift, either
    because they have too many hours, they have a time conflict, or
    they requested not to have that shift, are displayed in grey, with
    a small font, and their names crossed out.  In blue is the person
    currently assigned to the shift, in bold are the people who have
    requested that shift.  If your house has a rating system, the
    greener and larger someone's name is, the higher the rating they
    gave to the shift.

    <li>The left-hand pane can be sorted according to various
    criteria.  The arrow can be used to reverse the current sort.  In
    the case of a tie, the previous sort that you chose is used, so if
    you choose name, and then you choose hours, it will sort by how
    many hours are assigned, and among people with the same number of
    hours assigned, it will sort by name.  The default is name.  The
    others are points, date submitted, wanted, and hours.  Points is
    only meaningful if you uploaded the house list given to you by CO.
    If for some reason your house gives priority in shift assignment
    to people with lots of points, this can be useful to you.  Date
    submitted sorts by the date/time people submitted their preference
    forms.  The last submission by a member overrides earlier
    submission dates by that member.  Wanted sorts members by their
    desire to do the shift you're currently focused on in the other
    pane.  You also see this with the above feature of bolding, etc.,
    but this may be useful too.  Finally, hours sorts by the number of
    hours assigned to the person.

    <li>If you assign a person to a shift they can't do, for whatever
    reason, the page will warn you, although you can still assign it.
    If it's due to a time conflict with an unwanted time, the system
    will tell you that, and if it's because of a busy time, the system
    will tell you that.  It will not warn you if you assign to a time
    the member has put a question mark next to.  <a
    href='mailto:janak@berkeley.edu'>Let me</a> know if you would like
    that.

  <li><a name='table_print_features'><h4>Table printing features</h4>
  Printing tables is much like <a href='#table_edit_features'>editing
  them</a>.  Check and uncheck the columns until the page looks the
  way you want.  Then click on the print button to remove extraneous
  options and bring up a print dialog.  You can cancel the dialog if
  you wish, and print later.  However, to get back the cute features
  at the top of the page, you'll need to reload the page.  There may
  be bugs with how columns are displayed.  Try hiding the browser
  window and then bringing it up again, or resizing the window, if
  that happens.

</ul>

<li><a name='online_signoff_setup'><h4>Setting up online
signoffs</h4></a>
Go here for <a href='#online_signoff_running'>more information</a> on
actually running online signoffs.  For the actual setup, you have a
few options.  First of all, if you uncheck the "Enable online
signoffs" box, then there is nothing else to do.  You might want to
give online signoffs a shot, though -- here are a few reasons why: you
don't have to enter the data in, it's automatically put in for you;
verifiers and any changes from the usual shift are entered with the
shift, so you can easily see everything about this shift on one line;
you can require that verifiers enter their passwords, if you want,
which will cut down on fraud; and you can have the system email
verifiers every so often, to double-check on fraud.  If you would like
to have online signoffs, then there are a few parameters to set up.

<ul><li>The first is the maximum number of hours after a shift ends
that the member is allowed to sign off for it.  Many houses have a
policy that shifts have to be signed off for within 48 hours.  If you
do, then put that number here.  Note that the end time you specified
for a shift when <a href='master_shifts.php'>entering shifts</a> will
be used here.  If you omitted it, the shift will be assumed to end at
midnight on the day it was supposed to be done.  People can sign off
for shifts that are not scheduled to start yet.  Since you will be
able to review all the entered shifts, this is not a huge
risk. Weeklong shifts are assumed to be done on Sunday (the last day
of the week).  Thus, they can be signed off for at any point during
the week.

<li>Signing off online involves a verifier, just as it does on paper.
If you would like, you can require that the verifier enter their
password on the signoff page.  Then a member cannot use someone's name
without permission (unless they know their password).

<li>The system can automatically audit people signing off, by
sending emails to the verifiers to check that the verifiers really did
sign off those shifts.  (This is less of an issue if you require
verifier passwords above.)
<ul>
<li>To avoid overwhelming people with email, you can specify what
percentage of the shifts signed off online will generate emails.
Whatever number you put in here, that fraction of the time an email
will be sent.  If you put in 2, then 1 out of every 2 signed-off
shifts will be verified via email.  If you put in 10, then 1 out of
every 10 signed-off shifts will be verified via email.  If you put in
1, then every signed-off shift will be verified via email.

<li>In case the verifier doesn't have an email on file, email will go
to you.  The email to the verifier will also appear to be coming from
you.  For those reasons, you need to enter your email address here.

<li>You can set the subject line of the email.  You get to use
some <a href='#escape_sequences'>escape sequences</a> to make the
subject line more informative.

<li>Finally, you can also set the body of the email.  You can use <a
href='#escape_sequences'>escape sequences</a> again here.
</ul>
</ul>

  <li><a name='escape_sequences'><h4>Escape sequences</h4></a>Some parts
of the site will allow you to enter some text that users will see.
Often that text may have parts which are not fixed -- the user's name,
for instance, or the current week.  When that happens, there should be
a line that says something like "(You can use the following escape
codes to insert data into this text: %current_week will insert the
Current week)".  When you see this, you know that if, in your text,
you put "This week is week %current_week," then the user will see
"This week is week 7," in the 7th week.  Remember to put the escape
code in exactly as it's written.
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous Tasks</h3>

<ul><li><a name='person.admin'>If a member comes to you with a
question about their shifts, you can <a href='person.admin.php'>view
their personal page</a>, with all their data.  Each week has a line
giving exactly what happened that week with hours, fines, etc.  The
current week, which hasn't finished yet, is shown at the bottom, but
its totals are not included in the totals at the top of the page.

<li><a name='fining_data'>If there is a fine coming from outside the
system (for a blown bathroom clean, or the like), you can <a
href='fining_data.php'>enter it</a> and it will be added to their
fines.  Enter the date in m/d format (so June 22 is 6/22).  Note that
for houses in which you can work off fines, you need to enter the
credit in here, and also enter a shift of "Paying off fines" or
something similar in the <a href='week.php'>weekly sheet</a>, for
negative hours (however many they are cashing in).

<li><a name='special_fining'>Sometimes a member will have a fining
period end at a different week than the rest of the house.  This page
allows you to set that up.  -1 is the default value: it indicates that
the fining period takes place the same week as the rest of the house.
Leaving an entry blank means that this fining period is cancelled for
this member.  Entering another week means that this fining period will
take effect for this member at the end of that week, as opposed to the
normal week.

<li><a name='show_prefs'>You</a> can <a href='show_prefs.php'>view a
member's preferences</a> directly (usually you will double-click on
their name in the sidebar when <a href='assign_shifts.php'>assigning
shifts</a>).  This page will show the member's assigned shifts and
their preference form.  If you are using a rating system, then the
member's preferences as regards specific shifts will just be printed
out, with categories first, and then specific shifts.  If you are
doing wanted/unwanted, the unwanted shifts and then the wanted shifts
will be displayed in two tables.  Following that are any notes that
the member made, and finally, their schedule.  x means they can't do a
shift at that time, + means they want it, - means they don't want it,
but can do it, and ? means they don't know yet.

<li><a name='show_emails'>You</a> can <a href='show_emails.php'>view
the emails</a> of everyone in the house with an email address entered.
The system tries to make the names looks pretty, and you should be
able to copy this list directly into an address book or email message
(make sure you don't include the "No emails for:" part).

<li><a name='signoff'>Configuring <a href='signoff.php'>signoff</a>
sheets for printing can be confusing.  The first question is, do you
want your signoff sheet to be a grid with columns for the days, and
all the shifts down the side, or do you want just one day at a time,
with one or two days per sheet of paper?  If the first, you are going
to want to click on the Grid Format button.  If the second, then you
need to use the "daily sheet style."

<ul><li>The week number here allows you to print out the signoff sheet
specific to the week you're in.  If you're having a party one week and
you have a lot of extra party shifts that you've entered, or if you're
in temp weeks and the regular shifts aren't there, it will be very
useful to fill this in.  It will also print the dates out properly if
you do.  If you don't enter this, then the "generic week" with all the
regularly assigned shifts will be printed out, which in most cases is
the same.

<li>If you choose to show names, then the shift will be filled in with
the name of the person who is assigned that shift (whatever that
weekly sheet says, if you're printing out a specific week, or the
usual assigned shift, if you didn't say a week).  This makes it one
step faster for most people if they're signing off of their normal
shifts.

<li>You can leave a space for the verifier to write their name (either
in a separate column, in the daily view, or right below the shift, in
the grid format).

<li>Assuming you don't want grid format (and so you didn't click on
the Grid Format button), you come now to the selection of which days
you would like to see.  Check the days you want, and click submit.  If
you're doing this style, you probably don't want more than one or two
days printed at a time.  Note that unfortunately there isn't an easy
way to save which days you want to print out and use them over.  If
you really want that, I can probably arrange it for you -- let me
know.

<li>Now come some things you can change permanently about signoffs.
The first only affects the daily sheet style, but the second affects
both.  You can enter extra columns which will be printed out in the
daily sheets.  If, for instance, you would like a "notes" column where
workshifters can write notes about the shift, you can enter it here.
If you want the column to be a certain width (otherwise it will be
very narrow), enter the width immediately below it.  Make sure to
click the button at the bottom to update these values.

<li>You can also enter a signoff message, that will appear at the top
of signoff pages, both grid format and daily sheets.  When you compose
this message, keep in mind that you can use html (so you can make
things bold with &lt;strong&gt;, etc.).  But that also means that if
you enter something in html (like, for instance, the symbol &lt;), it
won't come out the way you want.  You'll need to enter something like
&amp;lt; for &lt;, and similarly &amp;gt; for &gt;, and so on.  Your
white space will be used, though, so if you hit the &lt;enter&gt; key,
there will be a new line.  Remember to click the button below to
permanently update this message.
</ul>

<li><a name='reset_user_password'
href='reset_user_password.php'>reset_user_password.php</a> will reset
any user's personal password, which they use to view their personal
page, preference forms, etc.

</ul>

<a name='advanced_tasks'><h3>Advanced Tasks</h3>
<ul>

  <li><a href='backup_database.php'>Backup your database</a>
  frequently.  This means that if you accidentally delete a week's
  shifts, or do something else really stupid, you can <a
  href='recover_database.php'>recover the database</a>.  Every so
  often, you might want to <a href='delete_backup_database.php'>delete
  an old backup if it's definitely not useful anymore</a>.

  <li><a name='view_backup_database'>You can <a
  href='view_backup_database.php'>view a backup database</a> as though
  it were the current database.  This allows you to do nearly anything
  you could want with a backup.  You shouldn't be editing it, but you
  can print out fines, etc.  Very useful if you need to see what
  someone's fines were at the end of a previous semester.  <a
  name='recover_backup_database'>If</a> you actually need to get back
  the archive as the current database, you can also <a
  href='recover_backup_database.php'>recover a backup</a>.  Recovering
  a backup will back up the current database, and then put the backup
  as the current one, so your members will see it as current, etc.
  You should only have to do this when you're going from summer to
  fall, and you want to recover the spring database, because the fall
  and spring setup are the same, and different from summer.
  Otherwise, recovering a backup is not a good idea, and you should
  ask your workshift website administrator if you think that you need
  to.

  <li><a href='table_edit.wrapper.wrapper.php'>View or edit a
  table</a> if for some reason you need direct access to a table.  You

<h2>More information on various pages.</h2></a>

  <li><a name='update_house_more' href='#update_house'><h3>update_house.php</h3></a>
  <ul>
  <h4>New members and old members</h4>
  <li>When you delete old members from the system, they're gone but
  not forgotten.  The system still stores their information.  Thus, if
  they come back to the house, they'll have the same password as
  before, as well as the same phone number, email, etc.  This is
  convenient, but it also means that you can't have a current member
  who has exactly the same name as an old member.

  <li>If you try to add the current member with the same name, if you
  do it with the CO list, then the system will check to make sure that
  the application numbers match.  If they don't, then it will take the
  new member's name and tack on their application number, to avoid
  confusion.  After you've added them, you can then go and rename them
  to what you want.

  <li>Note that if you upload a list without application numbers, the
  system has no way of knowing that this new person isn't the same as
  the old one, and so the old one will be re-activated, which will
  mean that their password, etc., are wrong.

  <li>When you're renaming a member, if you are renaming a new member
  to an old member's name, the rename page will give you two options.
  The first option is if this new member really is the old member, and
  you added them as a new member by mistake.  In that case, what you
  want to do is delete this new member and add the old member.  Note
  that you should only do this if you haven't yet done anything with
  the new member (assigned shifts, etc.).  If you've done anything, or
  they've done anything, it's better to take the second option.

  The second option is if this new member really is different, or if
  you have already entered important data (like shift assignments, or
  if they've submitted preference forms) for him/her.  In that case,
  you should delete the old member, and rename this new member to the
  old member.  The old member's info will be lost, but that's not a
  tragedy.

<h4>Other operations on the update_house page</h4>

<li>You can also rename members.  Note that, because adding/removing
  members is a potentially dangerous operation, the system backs up
  the database every time this happens.  You can override a backup
  being made during a rename (which is less dangerous, usually) by
  checking the box.  For what happens if you try to rename a new
  member to an old one, see above.

  <li>You can also add members manually (as opposed to enter houselist
  manually, below).  These members will be added to the houselist.  No
  one will be deleted.  Note that the caveats above about adding
  old members back applies here.  You should hardly, if ever, have to
  use this.  Boarders, and other people in the system who are not
  coming through CO are the exception.

  <li>You can delete members, one at a time or many at once by holding
  down the &lt;control&gt; key as you click.  Note that deleted people
  have their preference forms deleted, along with their shift
  assignments and any shifts they've done, so you don't want to do
  this unless the person has really left the house for the semester.
