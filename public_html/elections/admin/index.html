Follow these links to administer elections.

<ul>

<li><a href='create_election.php'>Create an election</a>.  Have to do
this before people can vote, obviously.

<li><a href='administer_election.php'>Administer an election</a> --
you can view who has voted so far, modify the election, finalize it,
pretty much do everything you can do to an election.

<hr>

<li>You probably already went here to get to this page, but <a
href='../../administer_users.php'>administer_users.php</a> lets you
add/remove user privileges, so if you want to make someone else the
President (i.e., able to administer elections), do it here.
