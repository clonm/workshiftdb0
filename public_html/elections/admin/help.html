<p>
Per-page help should be available by clicking the "Help" link on each
page.  To see all the features of the elections you can make, look at
the page for <a href='#create_election'>creating elections</a>.  You
can also look at <a href='#administer_election'>administering
elections</a> or <a href='#notes'>general notes</a>.
</p>

<p>The first thing you should do in this system is <a
href="../../admin/set_passwd.php">set the president's password</a>.
By default, it is &lt;house-code&gt;president (that's the user name
too), but your previous president may have changed it.  Go do that
now, then come back here.
</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Pages in the system</h3>

<ul><li><a name='create_election' href='create_election.php'>Creating
elections</a> is the biggest part of the system, and probably also the
most confusing part.  For most things, though, leaving it at the
default value should do the right thing.

<ul>
<li><p><b>Clone election</b>.  When you're creating a new election, the
  first thing you'll be asked is whether you want to "clone" an old
  election -- that is, start with your new election having the same
  races, descriptions, etc., as an older one.  In the next step,
  you'll be able to change anything that you want, but if, for
  instance, you have 15 manager positions up for election every
  spring, it's probably easier to clone the previous spring's election
  and then change the candidates who are running than to create 15
  races from scratch.  Cloning doesn't affect the old election at all,
  and, of course, votes in the old election aren't cloned -- the new
  election starts with a blank slate.</p>

  <p>When you've cloned an election, you still need to enter at least
  one, and probably two things.  Enter the name of the new election.
  You will also probably want to change the ending date to when the
  new election should end.  Finally, you should go through all the
  races and check to make sure they're all ok.  If there is a race
  where voters could make comments that other voters could see, you
  probably want to delete all those old comments, since they're not
  relevant anymore.</p>


<li><b>Name of election</b>.  Enter the name of the election.  You can
say "Manager VOCs" or "party theme" or whatever.  You don't need to
put in the year or semester -- the system will add those
automatically.  To make sure that the system will add the right
semester to the name, check that the semester it's displaying is the
right one.

<li><b>Is it anonymous?</b>.  Check the box if the election is
anonymous.  If an election is not anonymous, members can vote as many
times as they want -- their newest vote always erases the previous
one.  If the election is anonymous, voters will be given a "voter id,"
which they can use at the end of the election to check that their vote
was counted correctly.

<li><b>Can people view partial results</b>.  You have to decide if
people should be able to view election results before the election is
over.  For non-anonymous elections, this often isn't a problem -- it
can be fun for people to see which t-shirt choice is winning, and get
their friends to vote, etc.  For anonymous elections, viewing partial
results might be problematic, so you probably want to turn off partial
results for that, but it's your choice.  The default is no partial
results for anonymous elections, yes partial results for
non-anonymous.

<li><b>Ending date</b>.  Enter the date you wish the election to end.
People will not be able to vote after this date.  Note that by
default, the election ends at midnight on this day, and midnight is
the <b>start</b> of the day.  So if you want the election to run
through Friday, September 28th, 2007, and finish at midnight, then you
should enter <b>Saturday</b>'s date, i.e. 29-09-2007, because Friday
at midnight is actually the beginning of Saturday.  Please also make
sure to enter the date properly, in the form DD-MM-YYYY.</p>

<p>If you want the election to end at a non-midnight time, then enter
it below.  This might be useful if you want to end the voting right
before a meeting, or something like that.  Make sure that the server's
time is the same as yours.  If it isn't, then click on the link to <a
href="../../admin/tz_set.php">set the time zone</a>.
</p>

<li><b>Text at top of voter's page</b>.  If you want to put some
instructions about the election, or other description, you can enter
it into this box.  Note that you can enter text that will show up for
each race (see below), so you may not have that much to enter
here.</p>

<p>Normally, whatever you enter will be treated as plain text.
However, if you want to put fancy stuff in (like fonts and bold-face,
etc.), then you may want to check the box to treat it as HTML.  You
should know what you're doing if you do that, since otherwise things
like line breaks may disappear.</p>

<li><b>Upload file</b>.  In addition to (or instead of) having text at
the top of the page, you can upload a file with whatever you want in
it.  This file can be very useful if you have, for instance, a file
with all the candidate t-shirt images, or a file with the updated
bylaws (that you don't want to bother typing into the text box above).
Users will be shown the file if they can view it, and otherwise
they'll be prompted to download it.

<li><b>Races</b>.  This is the hard part.  Each election has one or
more races.  "Race" here is pretty general -- it can be a VOC or a
yes/no vote on a bylaw change or a ten-candidate race for house
manager.  Please see below for some <a href='#example_races'>example
races that your house might use</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Make it Yes/No</b>.  The two buttons at the top of each race
setup allow you to quickly set up two kinds of races -- all you have
to do is enter the name of the race.  Yes/No is an election with two
options -- yes and no.  If at least 50.1% of the voters don't vote
yes, then no wins.  Approved/Not Approved is the same idea, but
intended more for bylaw changes, so at least 66.6% of the house needs
to vote for Approved for it to win.  Note that you can set these types
of elections up yourself -- these buttons are just a guide to help at
first.

<li><b>Race name</b>.  Enter the name of the race, like "VOC House
Manager" or "T-shirt front design."  Try to keep it short.

<li><b>Description of race</b>.  Enter a description of this race, if
you think one is needed.  For instance, you could give a description
of the duties of the house manager here if people are voting on a VOC
for the house manager.  Note that this is treated as plain text, not
HTML, so no fancy formatting.

<li><b>Feedback</b>.  If this is a VOC in which your house is
commenting on the performance of a manager, then you want to have a
feedback race.  Each voter will have a text box into which she can
enter feedback, and this feedback will be displayed in the <a
href='../election_results.php'>results page</a>.  There are no
"candidates" and no "winner" and so all the other options are
irrelevant.  Note that if your VOC has both a section for feedback on
the performance of a manager and also a question of whether the
manager should get her comp, then you need to have two races -- one
for the feedback, and one for the question of comp.

<li><b>Candidates</b>.  Enter here the options in the race.  These
options could be the people running for the position, or Yes and No
for a ballot question, or the possible dates for a party, etc.  Note
that "Abstain" is not necessary -- the system will automatically
display an abstain option for voters if needed.

<li><b>Number of spots</b>.  This is usually one.  If there are
multiple spots to be filled (Cloyne has 3 Board Reps, so there are
going to be 3 winners in the election for Board Rep), then put how
many winners there can be in here.

<li><b>Options</b>.  This section is about how votes are counted.
"Nothing Special" means that this election is just like a normal
government election -- people vote for their favorite choice.  This is
great if you have exactly two options.  With more than two options,
there are problems with two candidates splitting the vote, and so on
(think Bush v. Gore v. Nader).  Thus, if your bylaws allow, you might
want to use "Instant Runoff" for those elections.  With instant
runoff, voters rank as many candidates as they like.  If no candidate
has enough votes to win, the candidate who has the fewest votes is
eliminated, and his/her/its voters are given to their next choice.
This keeps on going until a candidate is elected.  The results page
for instant runoff races shows exactly what is happening.  Finally,
Unranked Preferences is a system in which voters just say what choices
they like, and the system counts up those choices.  If you were trying
to decide when to have Special Dinner, and you wanted the greatest
number of people to be able to make it, you could have an Unranked
Preferences election in which you gave the possible dates, and
everyone checked off all the dates that they could make.  Then the
system would see which date had the most people who could make it.

<p>For those who care -- the election results page will also calculate
the winner for Condorcet and Borda forms of voting.  If one of those
is what your house uses, then choose the "Instant Runoff" option.  The
winner will be displayed for your method too, although the "announced"
winner may be incorrect.</p>

<li><b>Threshold issues</b>.
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, it's not enough to win -- you have
to win big.  Is this race like that?  "None" means no, whoever has the
most votes wins.  "At least __% of the vote is required" means that
for someone to win, they have to get at least whatever percentage of
the vote to win.  For instance, to terminate someone from the USCA
(now BSC), the house must vote yes by a 2/3 vote.  2/3 is a little more
than 66.6%, so you should say that at least 66.6% of the vote is
required.  "___ votes are required" means that there is an absolute
threshold before someone can win -- perhaps your house requires that
for a bylaw change, 2/3 of the house must vote for it, not just 2/3
of the voters.  Then you should put however many people 2/3 of the
house is in this spot.  Thus, if Stebbins has 64 people, and 2/3 of
the house needs to vote for a bylaw change, then at least 43 people
have to vote for it (42 isn't enough).  So the Stebbins president
should put 43 in this spot (assuming that's the rule at Stebbins).

<li><b>Will abstentions count</b>.  Depending on your house's rules,
if someone abstains in an election, that may be the same as not having
voted at all, or it might count as a vote for threshold purposes.  For
instance, suppose your house requires a 3/4 vote for a bylaw change,
and 40 people vote.  Since 3/4 was required, you put "At least 75% of
the vote is required" in for the threshold.  If 30 people vote for the
change and 10 against, then it passes, since 30 out of 40 is 75%.  Now
suppose 41 people vote, with 30 people for, 10 against, and 1
abstention.  Does it still pass?  If the answer is yes, since there
were 30 yes votes and 10 no votes, so 40 people expressed an opinion,
then abstentions do <b>not</b> count as votes.  If the answer is no,
because out of 41 voters, only 30, or less than 3/4, voted yes, then
abstentions <b>do</b> count as votes.

<li><b>Minimum number of votes</b>.  This number is like "quorum" for
an election.  Stebbins, for instance, requires that in a bylaw change
election, at least 2/3 of the house votes for the election to be valid
at all.  Thus, the Stebbins president would put 43 in there, since the
house size is 64.  Note that this number is not about who voted for or
against anything, it is just about who voted at all.  If your house
doesn't have anything like that, you can ignore it.

<li><b>Default</b>.  If you have any of the thresholds above
(percentage, number of votes, number of voters), it's possible that
nobody will reach the required threshold.  If that happens, what is
the choice?  You can leave this blank, in which case there will be no
winner, or you can enter one of the candidates.  For instance, with a
bylaw change, the two options are usually Approved and Not Approved.
If Approved doesn't get the required number of votes, then the bylaw
change is not approved, so Not Approved is the default winner.
</ul>

<li><b>Voter choices</b>.  This is more fun than the boring stuff up
there.  For some elections, you would like voters to be able to add
their own choices.  For instance, if you're voting on party themes,
voters should be able to suggest their own themes and vote for them.
If you check this box, there will be an option on the ballots for
voters to enter their own candidates.  Note that if the election is
anonymous, then people can't go back and change their votes, and so if
someone suggests a new candidate late in the election, not everyone
will get to choose it.  Thus, it's probably a good idea to get all the
candidates settled before you hold an anonymous election, but you can
still have this option if you want.  Note that, if you're doing
instant runoff, there's no real harm in having lots and lots of silly
choices -- they just won't get many votes, and will be eliminated
right away.

<li><b>Voter comments</b>.  This allows voters to make comments as
they're voting that all the other voters can see, so that your house
can have a discussion on each race even though they're not all in a
meeting together.  If the election is anonymous, then the comments
will be anonymous.  They'll also show up on the results page.  Note
that this isn't a great idea for VOC's -- it's more intended for
friendly discussion about things like party themes, or interpretations
of bylaw changes.  If voter comments are enabled and you come back to
this page to modify the election, you'll see a text box with all the
voter comments.  If there are some inappropriate ones, you can delete
them, but please exercise restraint in this, so that the house doesn't
feel stifled.  Note that editing the comments will be <a
href="#elections_log">logged</a>, so that the house can see that you
edited the comments (although not what you changed).
</ul>

<h4><a name='example_races'>Example races</a></h4>

<p>
Since the above can get very confusing, let's look at some concrete
examples.  Suppose we're having an election for house manager and
social manager.  You might want to call the election "Manager
Elections" (remember, its name will actually be 2007-fall_Manager
Elections), so put "Manager Elections" in for the name of the
election.  This election is probably anonymous, so check that box.
</p>

<p>
The first race can be called "House Manager", so that's what goes in
the race name.  Suppose Alexa, Bob, and Carmen are running.  Then the
candidates field would look like 
<pre>
Alexa
Bob
Carmen
</pre>
Let's say you've decided not to use instant runoff for this election.
Then you'd put "nothing special" in for the options.  Also, assume
your house doesn't have any requirements about how many votes someone
needs to get.  Then the Threshold would be "none".  You probably don't
want to let voters suggest new candidates after nominations are over,
and you probably don't want voters talking about the candidates on the
page, so don't check either of those checkboxes.  There!  Done with
that race.
</p>

<p>The second race is for social manager, so let's call it "Social
Manager".  Suppose that in this race, Davesh is running unopposed.
Also suppose that your house has a requirement that if someone is
running unopposed, then at least 2/3 of the house needs to vote for
him in order for him to be elected.  Then in "Candidates," you would
just put "Davesh".  Options would still be "nothing special," but for
the threshold, you would put "At least 66.6% of the vote is required."
Everything else would be left as it is.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's look at a different example.  Suppose we have an election
for the house t-shirt.  You'll want to either post the images on
another site and link to them, or create a file (like a Word document
or a PDF) with all the images, and upload them.  If you letter the
options A,B,C, and so on, then put those in the "candidates" field,
like so:
<pre>
A
B
C
</pre>
For this election, you probably want to use instant runoff -- people
should be able to vote for a less popular choice without feeling like
they're throwing their vote away.  So choose instant runoff.  You
probably don't have any threshold requirements for t-shirt voting.
Voters shouldn't be able to add choices themselves, because they
can't show the other voters their design, but they should be able to
comment on the designs, so you should check that box.
</p>

<p>
Let's do a VOC now.  Suppose that your house is holding a VOC on all
the managers.  There will be a lot of races.  If we look at just the
ones about the house manager, you might have two races: one that
allows members to give feedback to the maintenance manager, and one
that lets them vote on whether she should get her comp or not.  You
could name those races "Maintenance Manager Feedback" and "Maintenance
Manager Comp Release".  For the first race, just check the feedback
check box.  Look how all the other options go away!  There's only one
option left, which is to allow voter comments.  If you check that box,
then voters can give feedback to the Maintenance Manager, but also
make a comment that every other voter will see when they're voting.
You probably don't want that to happen, so leave that box unchecked.
</p>

<p>The second race is the question of whether the maintenance
manager's comp should be released.  The description can be "Should the
maintenance manager's comp be released?"  The candidates will be Yes
and No, so you should enter them in the "candidates" box like
<pre>
Yes
No
</pre>
Your house might require that 2/3 of the house vote Yes in order to
release her comp, so you should put 66.6 in for the percentage
threshold, and leave everything else blank.

</ul>

<li><a href='administer_election.php'
name='administer_election'>Administer elections</a>.  Administering
elections can be kind of fun.  When you go to the election's page,
you'll see a few things, depending on what stage the election is in.
At the top of the page is a list of everyone who has voted so far.  It
has their name, and also whether they were "manually entered."  This
last column is because the system allows people to turn in paper
ballots to you, the president.  All you have to do when they turn in a
ballot is enter their name as having voted so that they don't also try
to vote online.  Below that is a list of names and email addresses (if
they're entered) of people who haven't voted yet.  The list is handily
formatted so that you can just copy and paste it into an email to
these people to remind them to vote before it's too late.  Below that
will be a few links that depend on what stage the election is at.

<ul>
<li><b>Modify election</b> allows you to do just that, modify the
election.  You can change anything about it, except its name and
whether or not it's anonymous.  You can add and delete candidates,
edit member comments, change threshold rules, and do everything else
that you can do when you <a href='#create_election'>create an
election</a>.  However, try not to do this.  It's very suspicious to
change an election after you've created it, and any changes you make
will be <a href='#elections_log'>logged</a> so that people can make
sure you're not cheating.

<li><b>Enter a paper ballot</b>.  This option only shows up after the
election has ended.  Once it has ended, you can take any paper ballots
you've gotten from voters and enter them into the system using this
link.  Note that, since you could potentially cheat here, the system
will require two things: that you sign in, so that it knows who you
are, and that you have two witnesses also enter their names and
passwords, so that it knows you're not alone in your room, entering
fake ballots.  Ideally, you should do this in a public part of the
house.

<li><b>Finalize the election</b>.  After you're all done entering
paper ballots, you can click on this button to make the election
results final.  The only effect this has is that if the election was
set up to not show partial results, then only after you have clicked
this will anyone be able to see the results of the election.</p>

<p>If you finalized the election too early, and it turns out that you
have more ballots to enter, don't despair.  Click on the "Modify
election" link, change the end date to a day after today, and submit.
Then go back and change the end date back to the original.  Now you
can keep on entering ballots.</p>

<li><b>Delete election</b>.  After an election is finished, and its
results don't matter anymore, you should probably delete it.
(Otherwise your administration page will be a nightmare).  To delete
an election, check the Delete election? box, and click on the Delete
election button.  Since deleting an election is pretty serious (it
removes all record of it), you'll need witnesses to do this too.  Note
that once you have witnesses sign in, you can keep doing things for a
little while, so you can go through and delete several old elections
at a time.

</ul>

<a name='notes'><h3>Notes about the system</h3></a>

<p>
Everyone in your house should be in the workshift system, so that they
can all vote.  That will definitely be true if your workshift manager
used the CO house list.  However, some workshift managers entered the
house list manually, and so comped managers might not be on it.  You
should check with them, and get them to enter everyone in the house
in.
</p>

<p>There may be people in your house, like boarders, who are in the
workshift system but who shouldn't be allowed to vote.  You can make
them "nonvoters" who can't vote, by going to <a
href='../../admin/administer_users.php'>administer_users.php</a>.
</p>

<p>If your house is not ready to switch completely over to this
system, then that's fine.  You can run an election with paper ballots
as well as online ballots -- just follow the procedure above in
administering the election to enter people's names into the system as
they vote on paper.  Once the election is over, you can enter all the
paper ballots, and the system will tabulate the results as usual.

<h4>Security</h4>

Security is an important feature of this system.  Here are the major
security features that are built in:

<ul>
<li>If an election is anonymous, who cast which ballot is not stored
anywhere in the system, so nobody can access that information.
Instead, each ballot has a "voter id."  That voter id is displayed to
the member when she votes, and also emailed to her (unless she
requests that it not be).  When the election is over, the ballots are
all displayed on the results page, along with the corresponding voter
ids.  Thus, anyone can look at that page and confirm that her vote was
counted properly.  However, nobody else knows how she voted, since she
is the only one who knows her voter id.

<li>Every time a vote is cast, the vote is emailed to the voter's
email address on file.  They can choose not to receive that email when
they vote.  If they do that, or if they have no email address on file,
then that will be logged, since there is a potential for fraud if no
email is sent.

<li>Every action that anyone in the system takes that could be
suspicious is logged, and is available for everyone to see at <a
href='../elections_log.php'>elections_log.php</a>.  The following
actions are logged: you make a change to an election, someone changes
their password, someone changes their email, someone votes and asks
that their vote not be emailed, someone votes without an email, the
workshift manager changes the house list, the workshift manager resets
someone's password, the workshift manager restores a backup.  Of
course, you should trust your house members, but this allows people to
be more confident in the system.

<li>For actions you need to take that might be suspicious, you need to
have witnesses.  Thus, you need to have witnesses to enter paper
ballots into the system and to delete an election.

</ul>
