<li><a href='create_election.php'>Create an election</a>.  Have to do
this before people can vote, obviously.

<li><a href='administer_election.php'>Administer an election</a> --
you can view who has voted so far, modify the election, finalize it,
pretty much do everything you can do to an election.

<li><a href='../elections_log.php'>Make sure nobody's trying to cheat</a>.
<hr>

<li><a href='../../admin/set_passwd.php'>Change the president
password</a>.

<li><a href='../../admin/reset_user_password.php'>Reset the password of a user who has forgotten it.</a>

<li>Use the following two pages only if your house does not use the workshift
system, but you still want to use the online elections system.

<li><a href='enter_emails.php'>Enter email addresses for house members,
if they have not entered them themselves, for voting.</a>

<li><a href='password_mail.php'>Mail passwords to users who have email
addresses, but no passwords, so that they can vote.

<li><a
href='../../admin/administer_users.php'>administer_users.php</a> lets
you add/remove user privileges.  You should use this to make boarders
non-voters, so that they can't vote in elections.  Also if you want to
give someone else presidential powers (i.e., the power to administer
elections), do it here.
