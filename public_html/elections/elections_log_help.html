The Elections Log is meant to help everyone in the house make sure
that all elections are being run fairly.  Every action that could have
an impact on an election is logged.  Explanations of these actions are
below.

<ul>
<li><a name='manual_entry'>At the end of an election, the President
has to enter into the system any paper ballots that were filled out by
house members.  This must be witnessed by two other house members,
whose names appear in the log.  As well, you can see what each ballot
was, by clicking on the link.

<li><a name='president_modif'>The President has the ability to modify
parts of an election after it has been started.  She or he can
add/remove candidates, change uploaded documents, etc.  By clicking on
the link, you can see all the modifications that the President made to
an election.

<li><a name='delete_election'>The President has deleted an election
which has completed.  This action must be witnessed by two other house
members, whose names appear in the log.  All data from the election is
gone.

<li><a name='workshift_reset_password'>The workshift manager reset a
user's password.  It should be ensured that the user asked the
workshift manager to reset her/his password, and then set the new
value her/himself.

<li><a name='workshift_rename_member'><a name='workshift_add_member'><a
name='workshift_delete_member'>The workshift manager added/deleted/renamed one
or more members.  This is a routine action, but could conceivably be
exploited, so there should be a reason for it if it happens
during/close to an election.

<li><a name='voter_no_email'>A voter voted without an email address on
file.  Since voters receive confirmation of their votes by email, the
lack of an email makes the system have slightly less redundancy.

<li><a name='member_email_change'>A member changed her/his email
address.  Once again, since emails are used for confirmation, this
could conceivably be used as part of an exploit to vote for someone
else.

<li><a name='member_password_set'>A member set her/his password.  This
is routine at the start of the semester, but if it happens around
election time, the president should make sure that it was the member
who set the password.

</ul>
